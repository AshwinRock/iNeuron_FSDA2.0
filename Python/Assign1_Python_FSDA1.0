2.What is the difference between string and variable?

8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Ans: eggs can be a valid variable because it does not start with an integer and on the whole it is not an integer. But 100 is a value which is to be assigned
     to a variable hence 100 cannot be an integer.

9.What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

10.Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
  'I have eaten'+99+'burritos'

Ans: print('I have eaten',99,'burritos')
     The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator.
     The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.
