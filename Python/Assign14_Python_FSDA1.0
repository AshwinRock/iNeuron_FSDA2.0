1.What does RGBA stand for?

Ans: RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model used to represent digital images, specifying the intensity of these three color channels
along with the alpha channel, which represents transparency. The alpha channel determines the pixel's level of opacity, allowing for various levels of translucency.

2.From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?

Ans: To get the RGBA values of an image using the Pillow module in Python, you can use the getpixel method.
Example: rgba_value = Image.open("example.jpg").getpixel((x, y)). Replace "example.jpg" with your image file and (x, y) with the pixel coordinates.
The variable rgba_value will contain the RGBA values.

3.What is a box tuple, and how does it work?

Ans: A "box tuple" is not a standard term in computer science or programming. It might be a specific concept or technology introduced after my last update in January 2022.
Without further context, I cannot provide specific information about its meaning or functionality.

4.Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?

Ans: To determine the width and height of an Image object in a programming context, access the attributes or methods specific to the image library being used.
Commonly, you'll find properties like width and height or methods like size() providing the dimensions. Check the documentation for the specific library for details.

5.What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?

Ans: from PIL import Image
img = Image.new('RGB', (100, 100))
cropped_img = img.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))

6.After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?

Ans: To save changes made to an Image object, use the appropriate method provided by the image processing library you're using, such as PIL (Python Imaging Library).
For example, in PIL, you can use the save method to save the modified Image object to a file with a specified format and filename.

7.What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?

Ans: Pillow's shape-drawing code is found in the "ImageDraw" module. This module provides a drawing interface for creating and manipulating images.
It allows users to draw various shapes, lines, and text on images, providing a versatile set of tools
for image processing and graphical applications within the Pillow library.

8.Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?

Ans: Graphic objects, like those in graphical user interfaces or game development, have drawing methods. In these contexts, you work with classes or libraries
that provide graphical functionality. For example, in Python, the Pygame library offers a Surface object with drawing methods. 
Access such objects through the relevant library or framework.
