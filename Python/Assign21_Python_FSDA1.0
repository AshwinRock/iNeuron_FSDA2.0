1.Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.

Ans: from datetime import date
current_date = str(date.today())
with open('today.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(current_date)
print("Current date has been added to today.txt.")

2.Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string.

Ans: 
with open('today.txt', 'r') as file:
    today_string = file.read()

print("Content of today.txt:", today_string)

3.Parse the date from today_string.

Ans: from datetime import datetime
today_string = "2023-12-21"  # Replace this with the actual content of today.txt
parsed_date = datetime.strptime(today_string, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
print("Parsed Date:", parsed_date)

4.List the files in your current directory.

Ans: import os
current_directory = os.getcwd()
files = os.listdir(current_directory)
print("Files in the current directory:")
for file in files:
    print(file)

5.Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).\

Ans: import os
parent_directory = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.pardir))
parent_files = os.listdir(parent_directory)
print("Files in the parent directory:")
for file in parent_files:
    print(file)

6.Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of
seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.

Ans: import multiprocessing
import time
import random
from datetime import datetime

def worker():
    sleep_duration = random.uniform(1, 5)

    # Wait for the random duration
    time.sleep(sleep_duration)
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print(f"Process {multiprocessing.current_process().name}: {current_time}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = []
    for i in range(3):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, name=f"Worker-{i+1}")
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    print("All processes have finished.")

7.Create a date object of your day of birth.

Ans: from datetime import date

birth_year = 1990
birth_month = 1
birth_day = 1
birth_date = date(birth_year, birth_month, birth_day)
print("Date of Birth:", birth_date)

8.What day of the week was your day of birth?

Ans: from datetime import datetime
birth_year = 1990
birth_month = 1
birth_day = 1
birth_datetime = datetime(birth_year, birth_month, birth_day)
day_of_week = birth_datetime.strftime("%A")
print("Day of the Week for your Day of Birth:", day_of_week)

9.When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?

Ans: from datetime import datetime, timedelta
birth_year = 1990
birth_month = 1
birth_day = 1
days_old = 10000
birth_date = datetime(birth_year, birth_month, birth_day)
target_date = birth_date + timedelta(days=days_old)
print("Date when you will be 10,000 days old:", target_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
