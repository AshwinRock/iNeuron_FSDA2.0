1.What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?

Ans: Excel spreadsheets offer advantages over CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files due to their ability to store multiple sheets, cell formatting, formulas, and charts.
Excel provides a richer feature set, facilitating complex data analysis and visualization, making it suitable for diverse tasks beyond simple
data storage and exchange compared to plain text-based CSV files.

2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?

Ans: 
To create a reader object using csv.reader(), pass a readable file object or an iterable of strings containing CSV data. 
For a writer object using csv.writer(), pass a writable file object or a stream to which the CSV data will be written.

3.What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?

Ans: For reading, a File object needs to be opened in 'r' mode to enable read operations. For writing, it should be opened in 'w' mode to enable write operations,
truncating the file if it exists. To append data without truncating, use 'a' mode. Combining modes, like 'r+' or 'w+', allows both reading and writing.

4.What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?

Ans: The csv.writer() method in Python takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. It creates a CSV writer object that can be
used to write rows from the list to the file, ensuring proper formatting with commas as separators between values in the CSV file.

5.What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?

Ans: The "delimiter" in programming refers to a character or sequence used to separate values in a data structure, such as a CSV file. 
The "line terminator" signifies the end of a line. These keyword arguments are often used in file handling functions to define how data is structured or separated.

6.What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?

Ans: The json.loads() function in Python takes a string containing JSON data as input and returns the corresponding Python data structure. It parses the
JSON-formatted string and converts it into a native Python object, such as a dictionary or a list, making it accessible
and manipulable within the Python environment.

7.What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?

Ans: The json.dumps() function in Python takes a data structure, such as a dictionary or list, and converts it into a JSON-formatted string.
It serializes the data, ensuring compatibility with JSON syntax, allowing easy storage, transmission,
or interchange of information between different systems and programming languages.
